# AutoMills

The 'together.py' script is the latest iteration of the full working script, it seems to be applying the appropriate labels to the Mills Table results

- needs to be checked to see if it is really doing what we want (can we visualize this somehow?)
- need to remove all values not giving results



I am using this Mill's table as it is in farenheight with a minor change to add a missing temeprature point:  https://extension.psu.edu/tree-fruit-disease-an-apple-scab-review

This code is designed to implement the Mill's Apple Scab model on weather station data.

It is a work in progress...
