# AutoMills

This code is designed to implement the Mill's Apple Scab model on weather station data.

It is a work in progress...

Labeling: 

Label files according to what part of the project pipeline they will be in, for example; rain_events.py will deal with pulling out and processing rain events.
Label edited dataframe csv's so they can be indentified by their use, for example; rain_events.csv would be the data for rain_events.py




Progress:

I have had some success with the rain_events.py file, read the comment in the begging of the file to see what it does and does not do, I will try to comment at the end of the file what I am currently working on.
