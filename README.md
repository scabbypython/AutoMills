# AutoMills

I figured out the minute to hour thing however we may not need it.

Full walkthrough:

Track rain events (5 minute), blocks are unique events. If uniques events are more than 6 hours check temp

Temp is derived from the average of the the min/max of that uniques period

Use the average temp per unique event with unique event duration and print Mills Table result.

I am currently working on the "together.py" script to see if I can put it all together.



I am using this Mill's table as it is in farenheight:  https://extension.psu.edu/tree-fruit-disease-an-apple-scab-review

This code is designed to implement the Mill's Apple Scab model on weather station data.

It is a work in progress...
