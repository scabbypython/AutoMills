# AutoMills


Alex; I'm currently working on the Mill's table file, I am trying to code in the Mill's table, so something like; if temp = 46 and rain hours >=18 then print '17 Days until Lesions' and code that in for
each temp in range. I am using this Mill's table as it is in farenheight:  https://extension.psu.edu/tree-fruit-disease-an-apple-scab-review

This code is designed to implement the Mill's Apple Scab model on weather station data.

It is a work in progress...
